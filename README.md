# ionic-v4-angular-ngrx8
 
 Sample applicstion using the new v8 version of NGRX - this has removed a fair bit of the boilerplate code that usually makes using this kinda overwhelming. This sample only uses actions and reducers with the store; a more complete example using effects and selectors will be upcoming and a link posted here when that happens
